# Artificial Intelligence: Using Transformers via code in Python Language
The goal is use Transformer via code in Python Language

### Use tools:

- Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/
- Language Python: https://www.python.org/
- Page: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office
- Library Python:
   * transformers  beautifulsoup4 requests
   * openai

### Important Point:

- In my case, I used ``` Google Colab ``` how platform to write the script. But, you can use anyone of the preference.

### Showing:

1 - First, istall library: transformers  beautifulsoup4 requests and openai

   1) Library to request document from Web
   2) Operate with Berts Models 

3 - Function to prepare our Dataset:

Only need pass URL, where join in the visible text separete for space.

## Using the Pure Transformer
# 1 - Q & R (Question and Answer)

Remembering that Dataset is about Windows history, so the question need about it.
